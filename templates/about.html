    Hi, I'm Eric and welcome to my dev site where I share some of the personal
    projects I'm working on. Recently, I've been investigating what all the hype
    is surrounding htmx, and I've got to say &#8212; I'm a fan! By now, I've
    worked in all the popular javascript frameworks such as React, Svelte, etc.,
    but there's something very satisfying about using a minimal setup and
    returning the power back to the server. I built this site using 
    <ul class="list-disc ml-8">
      <li class="">Axum: a Rust server for the backend.</li>
      <li>Askama: a templating engine in Rust.</li>
      <li>htmx: an extension to HTML giving you reactivity in markup without the need for JavaScript.</li>
      <li>tailwindcss: for styling the frontend.</li>
      <li>fly.io: for hosting this site in a Docker container.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    In my free time, I enjoy playing all racket sports such as tennis,
    pickleball, badminton, and table tennis. I also enjoy paddleboarding,
    working out, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
